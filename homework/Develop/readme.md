## Purpose of this Project.

The purpose of this project is to go over code made by another developer to clean up and make it user friendly. The following were corrected:

* Worked with Dan and Sim to edit the .html and .css files.
* Changed the title of the website to a more descriptive title.
* Fixed the .css files by making it less redundant by drastically reducing the .class{}. 
* Necessary updates were made to the .html to match the corresponding classes in the .css
* Dan was able to experiment and find out the best combination of classes that still produced a working. Kudos to Dan.
